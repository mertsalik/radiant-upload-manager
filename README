RadiantUploadManager
====================

Flash version updated to 10.
e-haitam's RadiantUploadManager uses old Flash versions(8 and 9) so it doesn't working now.

This version is managed and controlled under Ubuntu and Windows x64 machines, 
so if you encounter any problem you can contact me.
===========================================================================

Radiant Upload Manager is an extension for Radiant CMS to enable the admin upload multiple files at once in a handy queue.

After installing the extension to you Radiant project:
======================================================
- run the update rake task

	>> rake radiant:extensions:upload_manager:update RAILS_ENV=production

- You'll find an extra "Upload Manager" tab in the admin interface. Files that admin upload go under /public/uploads/File
